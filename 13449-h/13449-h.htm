    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      The plain man on a plain day wakes up, slowly or quickly according to his
      temperament, and greets the day in a mental posture which might be thus
      expressed in words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord! Another day! What a grind!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      If you ask me whom I mean by the plain man, my reply is that I mean almost
      every man. I mean you. I certainly mean me. I mean the rich and the poor,
      the successful and the unsuccessful, the idle and the diligent, the
      luxurious and the austere. For, what with the limits of digestion, the
      practical impossibility of wearing two neckties at once, the insecurity of
      investments, the responsibilities of wealth and of success, the
      exhaustingness of the search for pleasure, and the cheapness of travel&mdash;the
      real differences between one sort of plain man and another are slight in
      these times. (And indeed they always were slight.)
    </p>
    <p>
      The plain man has a lot to do before he may have his breakfast&mdash;and
      he must do it. The tyrannic routine begins instantly he is out of bed. To
      lave limbs, to shave the jaw, to select clothes and assume them&mdash;these
      things are naught. He must exercise his muscles&mdash;all his muscles
      equally and scientifically&mdash;with the aid of a text-book and of
      diagrams on a large card; which card he often hides if he is expecting
      visitors in his chamber, for he will not always confess to these
      exercises; he would have you believe that he alone, in a world of
      simpletons, is above the faddism of the hour; he is as ashamed of these
      exercises as of a good resolution, and when his wife happens to burst in
      on them he will pretend to be doing some common act, such as walking
      across the room or examining a mole in the small of his back. And yet he
      will not abandon them. They have an empire over him. To drop them would be
      to be craven, inefficient. The text-book asserts that they will form one
      of the pleasantest parts of the day, and that he will learn to look
      forward to them. He soon learns to look forward to them, but not with
      glee. He is relieved and proud when they are over for the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would enjoy his breakfast, thanks to the strenuous imitation of
      diagrams, were it not that, in addition to being generally in a hurry, he
      is preoccupied. He is preoccupied by the sense of doom, by the sense that
      he has set out on the appointed path and dare not stray from it. The train
      or the tram-car or the automobile (same thing) is waiting for him,
      irrevocable, undeniable, inevitable. He wrenches himself away. He goes
      forth to his fate, as to the dentist. And just as he would enjoy his
      breakfast in the home, so he would enjoy his newspaper and cigarette in
      the vehicle, were it not for that ever-present sense of doom. The idea of
      business grips him. It matters not what the business is. Business is
      everything, and everything is business. He reaches his office&mdash;whatever
      his office is. He is in his office. He must plunge&mdash;he plunges. The
      day has genuinely begun now. The appointed path stretches straight in
      front of him, for five, six, seven, eight hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! but he chose his vocation. He likes it. It satisfies his instincts. It
      is his life. (So you say.) Well, does he like it? Does it satisfy his
      instincts? Is it his life? If truly the answer is affirmative, he is at
      any rate not conscious of the fact. He is aware of no ecstasy. What is the
      use of being happy unless he knows he is happy? Some men know that they
      are happy in the hours of business, but they are few. The majority are
      not, and the bulk of the majority do not even pretend to be. The whole
      attitude of the average plain man to business implies that business is a
      nuisance, scarcely mitigated. With what secret satisfaction he anticipates
      that visit to the barber&rsquo;s in the middle of the morning! With what
      gusto he hails the arrival of an unexpected interrupting friend! With what
      easement he decides that he may lawfully put off some task till the
      morrow! Let him hear a band or a fire-engine in the street, and he will go
      to the window with the eagerness of a child or of a girl-clerk. If he were
      working at golf the bands of all the regiments of Hohenzollern would not
      make him turn his head, nor the multitudinous blazing of fireproof
      skyscrapers. No! Let us be honest. Business constitutes the steepest,
      roughest league of the appointed path. Were it otherwise, business would
      not be universally regarded as a means to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, when the plain man gets home again, does his wife&rsquo;s face
      say to him: &ldquo;I know that your real life is now over for the day, and
      I regret for your sake that you have to return here. I know that the
      powerful interest of your life is gone. But I am glad that you have had
      five, six, seven, or eight hours of passionate pleasure&rdquo;? Not a bit!
      His wife&rsquo;s face says to him: &ldquo;I commiserate with you on all
      that you have been through. It is a great shame that you should be
      compelled to toil thus painfully. But I will try to make it up to you. I
      will soothe you. I will humour you. Forget anxiety and fatigue in my
      smiles.&rdquo; She does not fetch his comfortable slippers for him, partly
      because, in this century, wives do not do such things, and partly because
      comfortable slippers are no longer worn. But she does the equivalent&mdash;whatever
      the equivalent may happen to be in that particular household. And he
      expects the commiseration and the solace in her face. He would be very
      hurt did he not find it there.
    </p>
    <p>
      And even yet he is not relaxed. Even yet the appointed path stretches
      inexorably in front, and he cannot wander. For now he feels the cogs and
      cranks of the highly complex domestic machine. At breakfast he declined to
      hear them; they were shut off from him; he was too busy to be bothered
      with them. At evening he must be bothered with them. Was it not he who
      created the machine? He discovers, often to his astonishment, that his
      wife has an existence of her own, full of factors foreign to him, and he
      has to project himself, not only into his wife&rsquo;s existence, but into
      the existences of other minor personages. His daughter, for example, will
      persist in growing up. Not for a single day will she pause. He arrives one
      night and perceives that she is a woman and that he must treat her as a
      woman. He had not bargained for this. Peace, ease, relaxation in a home
      vibrating to the whir of such astounding phenomena? Impossible dream!
      These phenomena were originally meant by him to be the ornamentation of
      his career, but they are threatening to be the sole reason of his career.
      If his wife lives for him, it is certain that he lives just as much for
      his wife; and as for his daughter, while she emphatically does not live
      for him, he is bound to admit that he has just got to live for her&mdash;and
      she knows it!
    </p>
    <p>
      To gain money was exhausting; to spend it is precisely as exhausting. He
      cannot quit the appointed path nor lift the doom. Dinner is finished ere
      he has begun to recover from the varied shock of home. Then his daughter
      may negligently throw him a few moments of charming cajolery. He may
      gossip in simple idleness with his wife. He may gambol like any infant
      with the dog. A yawn. The shadow of the next day is upon him. He must not
      stay up too late, lest the vigour demanded by the next day should be
      impaired. Besides, he does not want to stay up. Naught is quite
      interesting enough to keep him up. And bed, too, is part of the appointed,
      unescapable path. To bed he goes, carrying ten million preoccupations. And
      of his state of mind the kindest that can be said is that he is
      philosophic enough to hope for the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after the night he wakes up, slowly or quickly according to his
      temperament, and greets the day with:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord! Another day! What a grind!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      The interesting point about the whole situation is that the plain man
      seldom or never asks himself a really fundamental question about that
      appointed path of his&mdash;that path from which he dare not and could not
      wander.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, perhaps in a parable, the plain man travelling met another
      traveller. And the plain man demanded of the traveller:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The traveller replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I come to think of it, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The plain man was ruffled by this insensate answer. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are travelling?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The traveller replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The plain man, beginning to be annoyed, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you never asked yourself where you are going to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you mean to tell me,&rdquo; protested the plain man, now
      irritated, &ldquo;that you are putting yourself to all this trouble,
      peril, and expense of trains and steamers, without having asked yourself
      where you are going to?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It never occurred to me,&rdquo; the traveller admitted. &ldquo;I
      just had to start and I started.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon the plain man was, as too often with us plain men, staggered and
      deeply affronted by the illogical absurdity of human nature. &ldquo;Was it
      conceivable,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;that this traveller, presumably in
      his senses&mdash;&rdquo; etc. (You are familiar with the tone and the
      style, being a plain man yourself.) And he gave way to moral indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I must here, in parenthesis, firmly state that I happen to be a member
      of the Society for the Suppression of Moral Indignation. As such, I object
      to the plain man&rsquo;s moral indignation against the traveller; and I
      think that a liability to moral indignation is one of the plain man&rsquo;s
      most serious defects. As such, my endeavour is to avoid being staggered
      and deeply affronted, or even surprised, by human vagaries. There are too
      many plain people who are always rediscovering human nature&mdash;its
      turpitudes, fatuities, unreason. They live amid human nature as in a
      chamber of horrors. And yet, after all these years, we surely ought to
      have grown used to human nature! It may be extremely vile&mdash;that is
      not the point. The point is that it constitutes our environment, from
      which we cannot escape alive. The man who is capable of being deeply
      affronted by his inevitable environment ought to have the pluck of his
      convictions and shoot himself. The Society would with pleasure pay his
      funeral expenses and contribute to the support of his wife and children.
      Such a man is, without knowing it, a dire enemy of true progress, which
      can only be planned and executed in an atmosphere from which heated moral
      superiority is absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      I offer these parenthetical remarks as a guarantee that I shall not
      over-righteously sneer at the plain man for his share in the sequel to the
      conversation with the traveller. For there was a sequel to the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As questions are being asked, where are you going to?&rdquo; said
      the traveller.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plain man answered with assurance:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know exactly where I&rsquo;m going to. I&rsquo;m going to
      Timbuctoo.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said the traveller. &ldquo;And why are you going to
      Timbuctoo?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Said the plain man: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going because it&rsquo;s the proper
      place to go to. Every self-respecting person goes to Timbuctoo.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Said the plain man:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s supposed to be just about unique. You&rsquo;re
      contented there. You get what you&rsquo;ve always wanted. The climate&rsquo;s
      wonderful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said the traveller again. &ldquo;Have you met
      anybody who&rsquo;s been there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve met several. I&rsquo;ve met a lot. And I&rsquo;ve
      heard from people who are there.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are their reports enthusiastic?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; The plain man hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer me. Are their reports enthusiastic?&rdquo; the traveller
      insisted, rather bullyingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very,&rdquo; the plain man admitted. &ldquo;Some say it&rsquo;s
      very disappointing. And some say it&rsquo;s much like other towns. Every
      one says the climate has grave drawbacks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The traveller demanded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why are you going there?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Said the plain man:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It never occurred to me to ask why. As I say, Timbuctoo&rsquo;s
      supposed to be&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Supposed by whom?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;generally supposed,&rdquo; said the plain man, limply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by the people who&rsquo;ve been there?&rdquo; the traveller
      persevered, with obstinacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; breathed the plain man. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s
      generally supposed&mdash;&rdquo; He faltered. There was a silence, which
      was broken by the traveller, who inquired:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any interesting places en route?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I never troubled about that,&rdquo; said the
      plain man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But do you mean to tell me,&rdquo; the traveller exclaimed, &ldquo;that
      you are putting yourself to all this trouble, peril, and expense of trains
      and steamers and camel-back without having asked yourself why, and without
      having satisfied yourself that the thing was worth while, and without
      having even ascertained the most agreeable route?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Said the plain man, weakly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just had to start for somewhere, so I started for Timbuctoo.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Said the traveller:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m of a forgiving disposition. Shake hands.&rdquo;

      The two individuals in the foregoing parable were worrying each other with
      fundamental questions. And what makes the parable unrealistic is the
      improbability of real individuals ever doing any such thing. If the plain
      man, for instance, has almost ceased to deal in fundamental questions in
      these days, the reason is not difficult to find. The reason lies in the
      modern perception that fundamental questions are getting very hard to
      answer. In a former time a dogmatic answer was ready waiting for every
      fundamental question. You asked the question, but before you asked it you
      knew the answer, and so there was no argument and nearly no anxiety. In
      that former time a mere child could glance at your conduct and tell you
      with certainty exactly what you would be doing and how you would be
      feeling ten thousand years hence, if you persisted in the said conduct.
      But knowledge has advanced since then, and the inconvenience of increased
      knowledge is that it intensifies the sense of ignorance, with the result
      that, though we know immensely more than our grandfathers knew, we feel
      immensely more ignorant than they ever felt. They were, indeed, too
      ignorant to be aware of ignorance&mdash;which is perhaps a comfortable
      state. Thus the plain man nowadays shirks fundamental questions. And
      assuredly no member of the Society for the Suppression of Moral
      Indignation shall blame him.
    </p>
    <p>
      All fundamental questions resolve themselves finally into the following
      assertion and inquiry about life: &ldquo;I am now engaged in something
      rather tiresome. What do I stand to gain by it later on?&rdquo; That is
      the basic query. It has forms of varying importance. In its supreme form
      the word &ldquo;eternity&rdquo; has to be employed. And the plain man is,
      to-day, so sensitive about this supreme form of the question that, far
      from asking and trying to answer it, he can scarcely bear to hear it even
      discussed&mdash;I mean discussed with candour. In practise a frank
      discussion of it usually tempts him to exhibitions of extraordinary heat
      and bitterness, and wisdom is thereby but obscured. Therefore he prefers
      the disadvantage of leaving it alone to the dissatisfaction of attempting
      to deal with it. The disadvantage of leaving it alone is obvious.
      Existence is, and must be, a compromise between the claims of the moment
      and the claims of the future&mdash;and how can that compromise be wisely
      established if one has not somehow made up one&rsquo;s mind about the
      future? It cannot. But&mdash;I repeat&mdash;I would not blame the plain
      man. I would only just hint to him, while respecting his sensitiveness,
      that the present hour is just as much a part of eternity as another hour
      ten thousand years off.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second&mdash;the most important&mdash;form of the fundamental question
      embraces the problem of old age. All plain men will admit, when faithfully
      cross-examined, a sort of belief that they are on their way to some
      Timbuctoo situate in the region of old age. It may be the Timbuctoo of a
      special ambition realized, or the Timbuctoo of luxury, or the Timbuctoo of
      material security, or the Timbuctoo of hale health, or the Timbuctoo of
      knowledge, or the Timbuctoo of power, or even the Timbuctoo of a good
      conscience. It is anyhow a recognizable and definable Timbuctoo. And the
      path leading to it is a straight, wide thoroughfare, clearly visible for a
      long distance ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theory of the mortal journey is simple and seldom challenged. It is a
      twofold theory&mdash;first that the delight of achievement will compensate
      for the rigours and self-denials of the route, and second that the misery
      of non-achievement would outweigh the immediate pleasures of dallying. If
      this theory were not indestructible, for reasons connected with the secret
      nature of humanity, it would probably have been destroyed long ago by the
      mere cumulative battering of experience. For the earth&rsquo;s surface is
      everywhere thickly dotted with old men who have achieved ambition, old men
      drenched in luxury, old men as safe as Mont Blanc from overthrow, old men
      with the health of camels, old men who know more than anybody ever knew
      before, old men whose nod can ruin a thousand miles of railroad, and old
      men with consciences of pure snow; but who are not happy and cannot enjoy
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theory, however, does happen to be indestructible, partly because old
      age is such a terrible long way off, partly because the young honestly
      believe themselves to have a monopoly of wisdom, partly because every
      plain man is convinced that his case will be different from all the other
      cases, and chiefly because endeavour&mdash;not any particular endeavour,
      but rather any endeavour!&mdash;is a habit that corresponds to a very
      profound instinct in the plain man. So the reputation of Timbuctoo as a
      pleasure resort remains entirely unimpaired, and the pilgrimages continue
      with unabated earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there is another and a paramount reason why the pilgrimages should
      continue. The two men in the parable both said that they just had to start&mdash;and
      they were right. We have to start, and, once started, we have to keep
      going. We must go somewhere. And at the moment of starting we have neither
      the sagacity nor the leisure to invent fresh places to start for, or to
      cut new paths. Everybody is going to Timbuctoo; the roads are well marked.
      And the plain man, with his honour of being peculiar, sets out for
      Timbuctoo also, following the signposts. The fear of not arriving keeps
      him on the trot, the fear of the unknown keeps him in the middle of the
      road and out of the forest on either side of it, and hope keeps up his
      courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will any member of the Society for the Suppression of Moral Indignation
      step forward and heatedly charge the plain man with culpable foolishness,
      ignorance, or gullibility; or even with cowardice in neglecting to find a
      convincing answer to the fundamental question about the other end of his
      life?
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p>
      There is, however, a third form of the fundamental question which is less
      unanswerable than the two forms already mentioned. The plain man may be
      excused for his remarkable indifference as to what his labour and his
      tedium will gain for him &ldquo;later on,&rdquo; when &ldquo;later on&rdquo;
      means beyond the grave or thirty years hence. But we live also in the
      present, and if proper existence is a compromise between the claims of the
      present and the claims of the future the present must be considered, and
      the plain man ought surely to ask himself the fundamental question in such
      a form as the following: &ldquo;I am now&mdash;this morning&mdash;engaged
      in something rather tiresome. What do I stand to gain by it this evening,
      to-morrow, this week&mdash;next week?&rdquo; In this form the fundamental
      question, once put, can be immediately answered by experience and by
      experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But does the plain man put it? I mean&mdash;does he put it seriously and
      effectively? I think that very often, if not as a general rule, he does
      not. He may&mdash;in fact he does&mdash;gloomily and savagely mutter:
      &ldquo;What pleasure do I get out of life?&rdquo; But he fails to insist
      on a clear answer from himself, and even if he obtains a clear answer&mdash;even
      if he makes the candid admission, &ldquo;No pleasure,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Not
      enough pleasure&rdquo;&mdash;even then he usually does not insist on
      modifying his life in accordance with the answer. He goes on ignoring all
      the interesting towns and oases on the way to his Timbuctoo. Excessively
      uncertain about future joy, and too breathlessly preoccupied to think
      about joy in the present, he just drives obstinately ahead, rather like a
      person in a trance. Singular conduct for a plain man priding himself on
      common sense!
    </p>
    <p>
      For the case of the plain man, conscientious and able, can only too
      frequently be summed up thus: Faced with the problem of existence, which
      is the problem of combining the largest possible amount of present
      satisfaction with the largest possible amount of security in the future,
      he has educated himself generally, and he has educated himself specially
      for a particular profession or trade; he has adopted the profession or
      trade, with all its risks and responsibilities&mdash;risks and
      responsibilities which often involve the felicity of others; he has bound
      himself to it for life, almost irrevocably; he labours for it so many
      hours a day, and it occupies his thoughts for so many hours more. Further,
      in the quest of satisfaction, he has taken a woman to wife and has had
      children. And here it is well to note frankly that his prime object in
      marrying was not the woman&rsquo;s happiness, but his own, and that the
      children came, not in order that they might be jolly little creatures, but
      as extensions of the father&rsquo;s individuality. The home, the
      environment gradually constructed for these secondary beings, constitutes
      another complex organization, which he superimposes on the complex
      organization of his profession or trade, and his brain has to carry and
      vitalize the two of them. All his energies are absorbed, and they are
      absorbed so utterly that once a year he is obliged to take a holiday lest
      he should break down, and even the organization of the holiday is complex
      and exhausting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now assuming&mdash;a tremendous assumption!&mdash;that by all this he
      really is providing security for the future, what conscious direct,
      personal satisfaction in the present does the onerous programme actually
      yield? I admit that it yields the primitive satisfaction of keeping body
      and soul together. But a Hottentot in a kraal gets the same satisfaction
      at less expense. I admit also that it ought theoretically to yield the
      conscious satisfaction which accompanies any sustained effort of the
      faculties. I deny that in fact it does yield this satisfaction, for the
      reason that the man is too busy ever to examine the treasures of his soul.
      And what else does it yield? For what other immediate end is the colossal
      travail being accomplished?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, it may, and does, occur that the plain man is practising physical
      and intellectual calisthenics, and running a vast business and sending
      ships and men to the horizons of the earth, and keeping a home in a park,
      and oscillating like a rapid shuttle daily between office and home, and
      lying awake at nights, and losing his eyesight and his digestion, and
      staking his health, and risking misery for the beings whom he cherishes,
      and enriching insurance companies, and providing joy-rides for nice young
      women whom he has never seen&mdash;and all his present profit therefrom is
      a game of golf with a free mind once a fortnight, or half an hour&rsquo;s
      intimacy with his wife and a free mind once a week or so, or a ten minutes&rsquo;
      duel with that daughter of his and a free mind on an occasional evening!
      Nay, it may occur that after forty years of incessant labour, in answer to
      an inquiry as to where the genuine conscious fun comes in, he has the
      right only to answer: &ldquo;Well, when I have time, I take the dog out
      for a walk. I enjoy larking with the dog.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The estimable plain man, with his horror of self-examination, is apt to
      forget the immediate end of existence in the means. And so much so, that
      when the first distant end&mdash;that of a secure old age&mdash;approaches
      achievement, he is incapable of admitting it to be achieved, and goes on
      worrying and worrying about the means&mdash;from simple habit! And when he
      does admit the achievement of the desired end, and abandons the means, he
      has so badly prepared himself to relish the desired end that the mere
      change kills him! His epitaph ought to read: &ldquo;Here lies the plain
      man of common sense, whose life was all means and no end.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A remedy will be worth finding.

    <h2>
      II - THE TASTE FOR PLEASURE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      One evening&mdash;it is bound to happen in the evening when it does happen&mdash;the
      plain man whose case I endeavoured to analyse in the previous chapter will
      suddenly explode. The smouldering volcano within that placid and wise
      exterior will burst forth, and the surrounding country will be covered
      with the hot lava of his immense hidden grievance. The business day has
      perhaps been marked by an unusual succession of annoyances, exasperations,
      disappointments&mdash;but he has met them with fine philosophic calm;
      fatigue has overtaken him&mdash;but it has not overcome him; throughout
      the long ordeal at the office he has remained master of himself, a
      wondrous example to the young and the foolish. And then some entirely
      unimportant occurrence&mdash;say, an invitation to a golf foursome which
      his duties forbid him to accept&mdash;a trifle, a nothing, comes along and
      brings about the explosion, in a fashion excessively disconcerting to the
      onlooker, and he exclaims, acidly, savagely, with a profound pessimism:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What pleasure do I get out of life?&rdquo; And in that single
      abrupt question (to which there is only one answer) he lays bare the
      central flaw of his existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The onlooker will probably be his wife, and the tone employed will
      probably imply that she is somehow mysteriously to blame for the fact that
      his earthly days are not one unbroken series of joyous diversions. He has
      no pose to keep up with his wife. And, moreover, if he really loves her he
      will find a certain curious satisfaction in hurting her now and then, in
      being wilfully unjust to her, as he would never hurt or be unjust to a
      mere friend. (Herein is one of the mysterious differences between love and
      affection!) She is alarmed and secretly aghast, as well she may be. He
      also is secretly aghast. For he has confessed a fact which is an
      inconvenient fact; and Anglo-Saxons have such a horror of inconvenient
      facts that they prefer to ignore them even to themselves. To pretend that
      things are not what they are is regarded by Anglo-Saxons as a proof of
      strength of mind and wholesomeness of disposition; while to admit that
      things are indeed what they are is deemed to be either weakness or
      cynicism. The plain man is incapable of being a cynic; he feels,
      therefore, that he has been guilty of weakness, and this, of course, makes
      him very cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t something be done?&rdquo; says his wife, meaning,
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t something be done to ameliorate your hard lot?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      (Misguided creature! It was the wrong phrase to use. And any phrase would
      have been the wrong phrase. She ought to have caressed him, for to a
      caress there is no answer.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know perfectly well that nothing can be done!&rdquo; he snaps
      her up, like a tiger snapping at the fawn. And his eyes, challenging hers,
      seem to say: &ldquo;Can I neglect my business? Can I shirk my
      responsibilities? Where would you be if I shirked them? Where would the
      children be? What about old age, sickness, death, quarter-day, rates,
      taxes, and your new hat? I have to provide for the rainy day and for the
      future. I am succeeding, moderately; but let there be no mistake&mdash;success
      means that I must sacrifice present pleasure. Pleasure is all very well
      for you others, but I&mdash;&rdquo; And then he will finish aloud, with
      the air of an offended and sarcastic martyr: &ldquo;Something be done,
      indeed!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighs. The domestic scene is over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, he may be honestly convinced that nothing can be done. Let us grant
      as much. But obviously it suits his pride to assume that nothing can be
      done. To admit the contrary would be to admit that he was leaving
      something undone, that he had organized his existence clumsily, even that
      he had made a fundamental miscalculation in the arrangement of his career.
      He has confessed to grave dissatisfaction. It behoves him, for the sake of
      his own dignity and reputation, to be quite sure that the grave
      dissatisfaction is unavoidable, inevitable, and that the blame for it
      rests with the scheme of the universe, and not with his particular private
      scheme. His rôle is that of the brave, strong, patient victim of an
      alleged natural law, by reason of which the present must ever be
      sacrificed to the future, and he discovers a peculiar miserable delight in
      the rôle. &ldquo;Miserable&rdquo; is the right adjective.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, in his quality of a wise plain man, he would never agree
      that any problem of human conduct, however hard and apparently hopeless,
      could not be solved by dint of sagacity and ingenuity&mdash;provided it
      was the problem of another person! He is quite fearfully good at solving
      the problems of his friends. Indeed, his friends, recognizing this,
      constantly go to him for advice. If a friend consulted him and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, I&rsquo;m engaged in an enterprise which will absorb all
      my energies for three years. It will enable me in the meantime to live and
      to keep my family, but I shall have scarcely a moment&rsquo;s freedom of
      mind. I may have a little leisure, but of what use is leisure without
      freedom of mind? As for pleasure, I shall simply forget what it is. My
      life will be one long struggle. The ultimate profit is extremely
      uncertain. It may be fairly good; on the other hand, it may be nothing at
      all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The plain man, being also blunt, would assuredly interrupt:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear fellow, what a fool you&rsquo;ve been!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet this case is in essence the case of the wise plain man. The chief
      difference between the two cases is that the wise plain man has enslaved
      himself for about thirty years instead of three, with naught but a sheer
      gambling chance of final reward! Not being one of the rare individuals
      with whom business is a passion, but just an average plain man, he is
      labouring daily against the grain, stultifying daily one part of his
      nature, on the supposition that later he will be recompensed. In other
      words, he is preparing to live, so that at a distant date he may be in a
      condition to live. He has not effected a compromise between the present
      and the future. His own complaint&mdash;&ldquo;What pleasure do I get out
      of life?&rdquo;&mdash;proves that he is completely sacrificing the present
      to the future. And how elusive is the future! Like the horizon, it always
      recedes. If, when he was thirty, some one had foretold that at forty-five,
      with a sympathetic wife and family and an increasing income, he would be
      as far off happiness as ever, he would have smiled at the prophecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consulting friend, somewhat nettled by the plain man&rsquo;s
      bluntness, might retort:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may or may not have been a fool. That&rsquo;s not the point. The
      point is that I am definitely in the enterprise, and can&rsquo;t get out
      of it. And there&rsquo;s nothing to be done.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon the plain man, in an encouraging, enheartening, reasonable tone,
      would respond:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, my dear chap. Of course, if you&rsquo;re in
      it, you&rsquo;re in it. But give me all the details. Let&rsquo;s examine
      the thing. And allow me to tell you that no case that looks bad is as bad
      as it looks.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is precisely in this spirit that the plain man should approach his own
      case. He should say to himself in that reasonable tone which he employs to
      his friend, and which is so impressive: &ldquo;Let me examine the thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the plain man who is reading this and unwillingly fitting the cap
      will irately protest: &ldquo;Do you suppose I haven&rsquo;t examined my
      own case? Do you suppose I don&rsquo;t understand it? I understand it
      thoroughly. Who should understand it if I don&rsquo;t? I beg to inform you
      that I know absolutely all about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the strong probability is that he has not examined it. The strong
      probability is that he has just lain awake of a night and felt extremely
      sorry for himself, and at the same time rather proud of his fortitude.
      Which process does not amount to an examination; it amounts merely to an
      indulgence. As for knowing absolutely all about it, he has not even
      noticed that the habit of feeling sorry for himself and proud of his
      fortitude is slowly growing on him, and tending to become his sole form of
      joy&mdash;a morbid habit and a sickly joy! He is sublimely unaware of that
      increasing irritability which others discuss behind his back. He has no
      suspicion that he is balefully affecting the general atmosphere of his
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above all, he does not know that he is losing the capacity for pleasure.
      Indeed, if it were suggested that such a change was going on in him he
      would be vexed and distressed. He would cry out: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you
      make any mistake! I could amuse myself as well as any man, if only I got
      the chance!&rdquo; And yet, how many tens of thousands of plain and (as it
      is called) successful men have been staggered to discover, when ambition
      was achieved and the daily yoke thrown off and the direct search for
      immediate happiness commenced, that the relish for pleasure had faded
      unnoticed away&mdash;proof enough that they had neither examined nor
      understood themselves! There is no more ingenuous soul, in affairs of
      supreme personal importance than your wise plain man, whom all his friends
      consult for his sagacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mind, I am not hereby accusing the plain man of total spiritual blindness&mdash;any
      more than I would accuse him of total physical blindness because he cannot
      see how he looks to others when he walks into a room. For nobody can see
      all round himself, nor know absolutely all about his own case; and he who
      boasts that he can is no better than a fool, despite his wisdom; he is not
      even at the beginning of any really useful wisdom. But I do accuse my
      plain man of deliberately shutting his eyes, from pride and from sloth. I
      do say that he might know a great deal more about his case than he
      actually does know, if only he would cease from pitying and praising
      himself in the middle of the night, and tackle the business of
      self-examination in a rational, vigorous, and honest fashion&mdash;not in
      the dark, but in the sane sunlight. And I do further say that a
      self-examination thus properly conducted might have results which would
      stultify those outrageous remarks of his to his wife.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      Few people&mdash;in fact, very few people indeed&mdash;ever realize the
      priceless value of the ancient counsel: &ldquo;Know thyself.&rdquo; It
      seems so trite, so ordinary. It seems so easy to acquire, this knowledge.
      Does not every one possess it? Can it not be got by simply sitting down in
      a chair and yielding to a mood? And yet this knowledge is just about as
      difficult to acquire as a knowledge of Chinese. Certainly nine hundred and
      ninety-nine people out of a thousand reach the age of sixty before getting
      the rudiments of it. The majority of us die in almost complete ignorance
      of it. And none may be said to master it in all its exciting branches.
      Why, you can choose any of your friends&mdash;the wisest of them&mdash;and
      instantly tell him something glaringly obvious about his own character and
      actions&mdash;and be rewarded for your trouble by an indignantly sincere
      denial! You had noticed it; all his friends had noticed it. But he had not
      noticed it. Far from having noticed it, he is convinced that it exists
      only in your malicious imagination. For example, go to a friend whose
      sense of humour is notoriously imperfect, and say gently to him: &ldquo;Your
      sense of humour is imperfect, my friend,&rdquo; and see how he will
      receive the information! So much for the rarity of self-knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Self-knowledge is difficult because it demands intellectual honesty. It
      demands that one shall not blink the facts, that one shall not hide one&rsquo;s
      head in the sand, and that one shall not be afraid of anything that one
      may happen to see in looking round. It is rare because it demands that one
      shall always be able to distinguish between the man one thinks one ought
      to be and the man one actually is. And it is rare because it demands
      impartial detachment and a certain quality of fine shamelessness&mdash;the
      shamelessness which confesses openly to oneself and finds a legitimate
      pleasure in confessing. By way of compensation for its difficulty, the
      pursuit of self-knowledge happens to be one of the most entrancing of all
      pursuits, as those who have seriously practised it are well aware. Its
      interest is inexhaustible and grows steadily. Unhappily, the Anglo-Saxon
      racial temperament is inimical to it. The Latins like it better. To feel
      its charm one should listen to a highly-cultivated Frenchman analysing
      himself for the benefit of an intimate companion. Still, even Anglo-Saxons
      may try it with advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The branch of self-knowledge which is particularly required for the
      solution of the immediate case of the plain man now under consideration is
      not a very hard one. It does not involve the recognition of crimes or even
      of grave faults. It is simply the knowledge of what interests him and what
      bores him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let him enter upon the first section of it with candour. Let him be
      himself. And let him be himself without shame. Let him ever remember that
      it is not a sin to be bored by what interests others, or to be interested
      in what bores others. Let him in this private inquiry give his natural
      instincts free play, for it is precisely the gradual suppression of his
      natural instincts which has brought him to his present pass. At first he
      will probably murmur in a fatigued voice that he cannot think of anything
      at all that interests him. Then let him dig down among his buried
      instincts. Let him recall his bright past of dreams, before he had become
      a victim imprisoned in the eternal groove. Everybody has, or has had, a
      secret desire, a hidden leaning. Let him discover what his is, or was&mdash;gardening,
      philosophy, reading, travel, billiards, raising animals, training animals,
      killing animals, yachting, collecting pictures or postage-stamps or
      autographs or snuff-boxes or scalps, astronomy, kite-flying,
      house-furnishing, foreign languages, cards, swimming, diary-keeping, the
      stage, politics, carpentry, riding or driving, music, staying up late,
      getting up early, tree-planting, tree-felling, town-planning, amateur
      soldiering, statics, entomology, botany, elocution, children-fancying,
      cigar-fancying, wife-fancying, placid domestic evenings, conjuring,
      bacteriology, thought-reading, mechanics, geology, sketching,
      bell-ringing, theosophy, his own soul, even golf....
    </p>
    <p>
      I mention a few of the ten million directions in which his secret desire
      may point or have pointed. I have probably not mentioned the right
      direction. But he can find it. He can perhaps find several right
      directions without too much trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you mean me to &lsquo;take up&rsquo; one of these things?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I do, seeing that he has hitherto neglected so clear a duty. If he had
      attended to it earlier, and with perseverance he would not be in the
      humiliating situation of exclaiming bitterly that he has no pleasure in
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he resists, &ldquo;you know perfectly well that I have
      no time!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To which I am obliged to make reply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sir, it is not your wife you are talking to. Kindly be
      honest with me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I admit that his business is very exhausting and exigent. For the sake of
      argument I will grant that he cannot safely give it an instant&rsquo;s
      less time than he is now giving it. But even so his business does not
      absorb at the outside more than seventy hours of the hundred and ten hours
      during which he is wide awake each week. The rest of the time he spends
      either in performing necessary acts in a tedious way or in performing acts
      which are not only tedious to him, but utterly unnecessary (for his own
      hypothesis is that he gets no pleasure out of life)&mdash;visiting,
      dinner-giving, cards, newspaper-reading, placid domestic evenings,
      evenings out, bar-lounging, sitting aimlessly around, dandifying himself,
      week-ending, theatres, classical concerts, literature, suburban
      train-travelling, staying up late, being in the swim, even golf. In
      whatever manner he is whittling away his leisure, it is the wrong manner,
      for the sole reason that it bores him. Moreover, all whittling of leisure
      is a mistake. Leisure, like work, should be organized, and it should be
      organized in large pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proper course clearly is to substitute acts which promise to be
      interesting for acts which have proved themselves to produce nothing but
      tedium, and to carry out the change with brains, in a business spirit. And
      the first essential is to recognize that something has definitely to go by
      the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      He protests:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do only the usual things&mdash;what everybody else does! And
      then it&rsquo;s time to go to bed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The case, however, is his case, not everybody else&rsquo;s case. Why
      should he submit to everlasting boredom for the mere sake of acting like
      everybody else?
    </p>
    <p>
      He continues in the same strain:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are asking me to change my whole life&mdash;at my age!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing of the sort! I am only suggesting that he should begin to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then finally he cries:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too drastic. I haven&rsquo;t the pluck!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we are coming to the real point.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p>
      The machinery of his volition, in all directions save one, has been
      clogged, through persistent neglect, due to over-specialization. His mind
      needs to be cleared, and it can be cleared&mdash;it will clear itself&mdash;if
      regular periods of repose are enforced upon it. As things are, it
      practically never gets a holiday from business. I do not mean that the
      plain man is always thinking about his business; but I mean that he is
      always liable to think about his business, that his business is always
      present in his mind, even if dormant there, and that at every opportunity,
      if the mind happens to be inactive, it sits up querulously and insists on
      attention. The man&rsquo;s mind is indeed rather like an unfortunate
      domestic servant who, though not always at work, is never off duty, never
      night or day free from the menace of a damnable electric bell; and it is
      as stale as that servant. His business is capable of ringing the bell when
      the man is eating his soup, when he is sitting alone with his wife on a
      warm summer evening, and especially when he wakes just before dawn to pity
      and praise himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he defends the position:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My business demands much reflection&mdash;constant watchfulness.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, in the first place, an enterprise which demands watchfulness day and
      night from the same individual is badly organized, and should be
      reorganized. It runs contrary to the common sense of Nature. And, in the
      second place, his defence is insincere. He does not submit to the eternal
      preoccupation because he thinks he ought, but simply because he cannot
      help it. How often, especially just before the dawn, has he not longed to
      be delivered from the perfectly futile preoccupation, so that he might go
      to sleep again&mdash;and failed to get free! How often, in the midst of
      some jolly gathering, has he not felt secretly desolate because the one
      tyrannic topic would run round and round in his mind, just like a
      clockwork mouse, accomplishing no useful end, and making impossible any
      genuine participation in the gaiety that environs him!
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of being necessary to the success of his business, this morbid
      preoccupation is positively detrimental to his business. He would think
      much more usefully, more powerfully, more creatively, about his business
      if during at least thirteen consecutive hours each day he never thought of
      it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there is still a further point in this connection. Let him imagine how
      delightful it must be for the people in the home which he has made, the
      loving people whom he loves and to whom in theory he is devoting his
      career, to feel continually that he only sees them obscurely through the
      haze emanating from his business! Why&mdash;worse!&mdash;even when he is
      sitting with his wife, he and she might as well be communicating with each
      other across a grille against which a turnkey is standing and listening to
      every word said! Let him imagine how flattering for her! She might be more
      flattered, at any rate more thrilled, if she knew that instead of thinking
      about his business he was thinking about another woman. Could he shut the
      front door every afternoon on his business, the effect would not only be
      beneficial upon it and upon him, but his wife would smile the warm smile
      of wisdom justified. Like most women, she has a firmer grasp of the
      essence of life than the man upon whom she is dependent. She knows with
      her heart (what he only knows with his brain) that business, politics, and
      &ldquo;all that sort of thing&rdquo; are secondary to real existence, the
      mere preliminaries of it. She would rejoice, in the blush of the
      compliment he was paying her, that he had at last begun to comprehend the
      ultimate values!
    </p>
    <p>
      So far as I am aware, there is no patent device for suddenly gaining that
      control of the mind which will enable one to free it from an obsession
      such as the obsession of the plain man. The desirable end can, however, be
      achieved by slow degrees, and by an obvious method which contains naught
      of the miraculous. If the victim of the obsession will deliberately try to
      think of something else, or to think of nothing at all&mdash;every time he
      catches himself in the act of thinking about his business out of hours, he
      certainly will, sooner or later&mdash;probably in about a fortnight&mdash;cure
      the obsession, or at least get the upper hand of it. The treatment demands
      perseverance, but it emphatically does not demand an impossibly powerful
      effort. It is an affair of trifling pertinacious touches.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a treatment easier to practise during daylight, in company, when
      distractions are plentiful, than in the solitude of the night.
      Triumphantly to battle with an obsession at night, when the vitality is
      low and the egoism intensified, is extremely difficult. But the small
      persistent successes of the day will gradually have their indirect
      influence on the night. A great deal can also be done by simple resolute
      suggestion. Few persons seem to know&mdash;what is, nevertheless, a fact&mdash;that
      the most effective moment for making resolves is in the comatose calm
      which precedes going to sleep. The entire organism is then in a passive
      state, and more permanently receptive of the imprint of volition than at
      any other period of the twenty-four hours. If regularly at that moment the
      man says clearly and imperiously to himself, &ldquo;I will not allow my
      business to preoccupy me at home; I will not allow my business to
      preoccupy me at home; I will not allow my business to preoccupy me at
      home,&rdquo; he will be astonished at the results; which results, by the
      way, are reached by subconscious and therefore unperceived channels whose
      workings we can only guess at.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the obsession is beaten, destroyed, he will find himself not
      merely fortified with the necessary pluck and initiative for importing a
      new interest into his existence. His instincts of their own accord will be
      asking for that interest, for they will have been set free.
    </p>
    <h3>
      V
    </h3>
    <p>
      In choosing a distraction&mdash;that is to say, in choosing a rival to his
      business&mdash;he should select some pursuit whose nature differs as much
      as possible from the nature of his business, and which will bring into
      activity another side of his character. If his business is monotonous,
      demanding care and solicitude rather than irregular intense efforts of the
      brain, then let his distraction be such as will make a powerful call upon
      his brain. But if, on the other hand, the course of his business runs in
      crises that string up the brain to its tightest strain, then let his
      distraction be a foolish and merry one. Many men fall into the error of
      assuming that their hobbies must be as dignified and serious as their
      vocations, though surely the example of the greatest philosophers ought to
      have taught them better! They seem to imagine that they should continually
      be improving themselves, in either body or mind. If they take up a sport,
      it is because the sport may improve their health. And if the hobby is
      intellectual it must needs be employed to improve their brain. The fact is
      that their conception of self-improvement is too narrow. In their
      restricted sense of the phrase, they possibly don&rsquo;t need improving;
      they possibly are already improved to the point of being a nuisance to
      their fellow-creatures; possibly what they need is worsening. In the broad
      and full sense of the phrase self-improvement, a course of self-worsening
      might improve them. I have known men&mdash;and everybody has known them&mdash;who
      would approach nearer to perfection if they could only acquire a little
      carelessness, a little absent-mindedness, a little illogicalness, a little
      irrational and infantile gaiety, a little unscrupulousness in the matter
      of the time of day. These considerations should be weighed before certain
      hobbies are dismissed as being unworthy of a plain man&rsquo;s notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then comes the hour of decision, in which the wise plain man should exert
      all that force of will for which he is famous in his house. For this hour
      may be of supreme importance&mdash;may be the close of one epoch in his
      life and the beginning of another. The more volitional energy he can
      concentrate in it, the more likely is he to succeed in the fine enterprise
      of his own renaissance. He must resolve with as much intensity of will as
      he once put into the resolution which sent him to propose marriage to his
      wife. And, indeed, he must be ready to treat his hobby somewhat as though
      it were a woman desired&mdash;with splendid and uncalculating generosity.
      He must shower money on it, and, what is more, he must shower time on it.
      He must do the thing properly. A hobby is not a hobby until it is
      glorified, until some real sacrifice has been made for it. If he has
      chosen a hobby that is costly, both in money and in time, if it is a hobby
      difficult for a busy and prudent man to follow, all the better. If it
      demands that his business shall suffer a little, and that his life-long
      habits of industry shall seem to be jeopardized, again all the better.
      For, you know, despite his timid fears, his business will not suffer, and
      lifelong habits, even good ones, are not easily jeopardized. One of the
      most precious jewels of advice ever offered to the plain man was that he
      should acquire industrious habits, and then try to lose them! He will soon
      find that he cannot lose them, but the transient struggles against them
      will tend always to restore the sane balance of his nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must deliberately arrange pleasures for himself in connection with his
      hobby, and as often as possible. Once a week at least his programme should
      comprise some item of relaxation to which he can look forward with
      impatience because he has planned it, and because he has compelled
      seemingly more urgent matters to give way to it; and look forward to it he
      must, tasting it in advance, enjoying it twice over! Thus may the appetite
      for pleasure, the ability really to savour it, be restored&mdash;and
      incidentally kept in good trim for full use when old age arrives and he
      enters the lotus-land. And with it all, when the hour of enjoyment comes,
      he must insist on his mind being free; expelling every preoccupation,
      nonchalantly accepting risks like a youth, he must abandon himself to the
      hour. Let him practise lightheartedness as though it were charity. Indeed,
      it is charity&mdash;to his household, for instance. Ask his household.
    </p>
    <p>
      He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All this is very dangerous. My friends won&rsquo;t recognize me. I
      may go too far. I may become an idler and a spendthrift.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Have no fear.

      III - THE RISKS OF LIFE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I
    </h3>
    <p>
      By one of those coincidences for which destiny is sometimes responsible,
      the two very opposite plain men whom I am going to write about were most
      happily named Mr. Alpha and Mr. Omega; for, owing to a difference of
      temperament, they stood far apart, at the extreme ends of the scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      In youth, of course, the differences between them was not fully apparent;
      such differences seldom are fully apparent in youth. It first made itself
      felt in a dramatic way, on the evening when Mr. Alpha wanted to go to the
      theatre and Mr. Omega didn&rsquo;t. At this period they were both young
      and both married, and the two couples shared a flat together. Also, they
      were both getting on very well in their careers, by which is meant that
      they both had spare cash to rattle in the pockets of their
      admirably-creased trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to the theatre with us to-night, Omega?&rdquo; said Mr. Alpha.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we will,&rdquo; said Mr. Omega.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we particularly want you to,&rdquo; insisted Mr. Alpha.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it can&rsquo;t be done,&rdquo; said Mr. Omega.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got another engagement?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why won&rsquo;t you come? You don&rsquo;t mean to tell me you&rsquo;re
      hard up?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; said Mr. Omega.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself. What have you been doing
      with your money lately?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve taken out a biggish life assurance policy, and the
      premiums will be a strain. I paid the first yesterday. I&rsquo;m bled
      white.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Holy Moses!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Alpha, shrugging his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flat was shortly afterwards to let. The exclamation &ldquo;Holy Moses!&rdquo;
      may be in itself quite harmless, and innocuous to friendship, if it is
      pronounced in the right, friendly tone. Unfortunately Mr. Alpha used it
      with a sarcastic inflection, implying that he regarded Mr. Omega as a
      prig, a fussy old person, a miser, a spoilsport, and, indeed, something
      less than a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can only live your life once,&rdquo; said Mr. Alpha.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they curved gradually apart. This was in 1893.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      Nearly twenty years later&mdash;that is to say, not long since&mdash;I had
      a glimpse of Mr. Alpha at a Saturday lunch. Do not imagine that Mr. Alpha&rsquo;s
      Saturday lunch took place in a miserable garret, amid every circumstance
      of failure and shame. Success in life has very little to do with prudence.
      It has a great deal to do with courage, initiative, and individual force,
      and also it is not unconnected with sheer luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Alpha had succeeded in life, and the lunch at which I assisted took
      place in a remarkably spacious and comfortable house surrounded by
      gardens, greenhouses, garages, stables, and all the minions necessary to
      the upkeep thereof. Mr. Alpha was a jolly, a kind-hearted, an immensely
      clever, and a prolific man. I call him prolific because he had five
      children. There he was, with his wife and the five children; and they were
      all enjoying the lunch and themselves to an extraordinary degree. It was a
      delight to be with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is necessarily a delight to be with people who are intelligent,
      sympathetic and lively, and who have ample money to satisfy their desires.
      Somehow you can hear the gold chinking, and the sound is good to the human
      ear. Even the youngest girl had money in her nice new purse, to do with it
      as she liked. For Mr. Alpha never stinted. He was generous by instinct,
      and he wanted everybody to be happy. In fact, he had turned out quite an
      unusual father. At the same time he fell short of being an absolute angel
      of acquiescence and compliance. For instance, his youngest child, a girl,
      broached the subject of music at that very lunch. She was fourteen, and
      had shown some of her father&rsquo;s cleverness at a school musical
      examination. She was rather uplifted about her music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I take it up seriously, dad?&rdquo; she said, with the
      extreme gravity of her years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The better you play, the more we
      shall all be pleased. Don&rsquo;t you think we deserve some reward for all
      we&rsquo;ve suffered under your piano-practising?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I mean seriously,&rdquo; she insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my pet,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t reckon you
      could be a star pianist, do you? Fifteen hundred dollars a concert, and so
      on?&rdquo; And, as she was sitting next to him, he affectionately pinched
      her delicious ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she admitted. &ldquo;But I could teach. I should like to
      teach.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Teach!&rdquo; He repeated the word in a changed tone. &ldquo;Teach!
      What in Heaven&rsquo;s name should you want to teach for? I don&rsquo;t
      quite see a daughter of mine teaching.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No more was said on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman and I are on rather confidential terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a shame, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she said to me afterwards,
      with feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to be done?&rdquo; I inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;I knew there wasn&rsquo;t before I
      started. The dad would never hear of me earning my own living.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The two elder girls&mdash;twins&mdash;had no leaning towards music, and no
      leaning towards anything save family affection and social engagements.
      They had a grand time, and the grander the time they had the keener was
      the delight of Mr. Alpha in their paradisaical existence. Truly he was a
      pearl among fathers. The children themselves admitted it, and children can
      judge. The second son wished to be a painter. Many a father would have
      said, &ldquo;I shall stand none of this nonsense about painting. The
      business is there, and into the business you&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo; But not
      Mr. Alpha. What Mr. Alpha said to his second son amounted to this: &ldquo;I
      shall be charmed for a son of mine to be a painter. Go ahead. Don&rsquo;t
      worry. Don&rsquo;t hurry. I will give you an ample allowance to keep you
      afloat through the years of struggle. You shall not be like other
      beginners. You shall have nothing to think of but your profession. You
      shall be in a position to wait. Instead of you running after the dealers,
      you shall comfortably bide your time until the dealers run after you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This young man of eighteen was precocious and extravagant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, mater,&rdquo; he said, over the cheese, &ldquo;can you lend
      me fifty dollars?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Alpha broke in sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you worrying your mother about money for? You know I won&rsquo;t
      have it. And I won&rsquo;t have you getting into debt either.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dad, will you buy a picture from me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do me a good sketch of your mother, and I&rsquo;ll give you fifty
      dollars for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cash in advance?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;on your promise. But understand, no debts.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The eldest son, fitly enough, was in the business. Not, however, too much
      in the business. He put in time at the office regularly. He was going to
      be a partner, and the business would ultimately descend to him. But the
      business wrinkled not his brow. Mr. Alpha was quite ready to assume every
      responsibility and care. He had brains and energy enough, and something
      considerable over. Enough over, indeed, to run the house and grounds. Mrs.
      Alpha could always sleep soundly at night secure in the thought that her
      husband would smooth away every difficulty for her. He could do all things
      so much more efficiently than she could, were it tackling a cook or a
      tradesman, or deciding about the pattern of flowers in a garden-bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the finish of the luncheon the painter, who had been meditative,
      suddenly raised his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen,&rdquo; he announced, with solemnity, &ldquo;I
      beg to move that father be and hereby is a brick.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carried nem. con.,&rdquo; said the eldest son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loud cheers!&rdquo; said the more pert of the twins.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Alpha was enchanted with his home and his home-life.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      That luncheon was the latest and the most profound of a long series of
      impressions which had been influencing my mental attitude towards the
      excellent, the successful, the entirely agreeable Mr. Alpha. I walked
      home, a distance of some three miles, and then I walked another three
      miles or so on the worn carpet of my study, and at last the cup of my
      feelings began to run over, and I sat down and wrote a letter to my friend
      Alpha. The letter was thus couched:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Dear Alpha,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have long wanted to tell you something, and now I have decided to
      give vent to my desire. There are two ways of telling you. I might take
      the circuitous route by roundabout and gentle phrases, through hints and
      delicately undulating suggestions, and beneath the soft shadow of
      flattering cajoleries. Or I might dash straight ahead. The latter is the
      best, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a scoundrel, my dear Alpha. I say it in the friendliest and
      most brutal manner. And you are not merely a scoundrel&mdash;you are the
      most dangerous sort of scoundrel&mdash;the smiling, benevolent scoundrel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know quite well that your house, with all that therein is,
      stands on the edge of a precipice, and that at any moment a landslip might
      topple it over into everlasting ruin. And yet you behave as though your
      house was planted in the midst of a vast and secure plain, sheltered from
      every imaginable havoc. I speak metaphorically, of course. It is not a
      material precipice that your house stands on the edge of; it is a
      metaphorical precipice. But the perils symbolized by that precipice are
      real enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, for example, a real chauffeur whose real wrist may by a
      single false movement transform you from the incomparable Alpha into an
      item in the books of the registrar of deaths. It is a real microbe who may
      at this very instant be industriously planning your swift destruction. And
      it is another real microbe who may have already made up his or her mind
      that you shall finish your days helpless and incapable on the flat of your
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose you to be dead&mdash;what would happen? You would leave
      debts, for, although you are solvent, you are only solvent because you
      have the knack of always putting your hand on money, and death would
      automatically make you insolvent. You are one of those brave, jolly
      fellows who live up to their income. It is true that, in deference to
      fashion, you are now insured, but for a trifling and inadequate sum which
      would not yield the hundredth part of your present income. It is true that
      there is your business. But your business would be naught without you. You
      are your business. Remove yourself from it, and the residue is negligible.
      Your son, left alone with it, would wreck it in a year through simple
      ignorance and clumsiness; for you have kept him in his inexperience like a
      maiden in her maidenhood. You say that you desired to spare him. Nothing
      of the kind. You were merely jealous, of your authority, and your
      indispensability. You desired fervently that all and everybody should
      depend on yourself....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Conceive that three years have passed and that you are in fact
      dead. You are buried; you are lying away over there in the cold dark. The
      funeral is done. The friends are gone. But your family is just as alive as
      ever. Disaster has not killed it, nor even diminished its vitality. It
      wants just as much to eat and drink as it did before sorrow passed over
      it. Look through the sod. Do you see that child there playing with a
      razor? It is your eldest son at grips with your business. Do you see that
      other youngster striving against a wolf with a lead pencil for weapon? It
      is your second son. Well, they are males, these two, and must manfully
      expect what they get. But do you see these four creatures with their hands
      cut off, thrust out into the infested desert? They are your wife and your
      daughters. You cut their hands off. You did it so kindly and persuasively.
      And that chiefly is why you are a scoundrel. ...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You educated all these women in a false and abominable doctrine.
      You made them believe, and you forced them to act up to the belief, that
      money was a magic thing, and that they had a magic power over it. All they
      had to do was to press a certain button, or to employ a certain pretty
      tone, and money would flow forth like water from the rock of Moses. And so
      far as they were concerned money actually did behave in this convenient
      fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But all the time you were deceiving them by a conjuring-trick, just
      as priests of strange cults deceive their votaries.... And further, you
      taught them that money had but one use&mdash;to be spent. You may&mdash;though
      by a fluke&mdash;have left a quantity of money to your widow, but her sole
      skill is to spend it. She has heard that there is such a thing as
      investing money. She tries to invest it. But, bless you, you never said a
      word to her about that, and the money vanishes now as magically as it once
      magically appeared in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you compelled all these four women to live so that money and
      luxury and servants and idleness were absolutely essential to them if
      their existence was to be tolerable. And what is worse, you compelled them
      to live so that, deprived of magic money, they were incapable of existing
      at all, tolerably or intolerably. Either they must expire in misery&mdash;after
      their splendid career with you!&mdash;or they must earn existence by
      smiles and acquiescences and caresses. (For you cut their hands off.) They
      must beg for their food and raiment. There are different ways of begging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you protest that you did it out of kindness, and because you
      wanted them to have a real good time. My good Alpha, it is absurd for a
      man to argue that he cut off a woman&rsquo;s hands out of kindness. Human
      beings are so incredulous, so apt to think evil, that such arguments
      somehow fail to carry conviction. I am fairly credulous myself, but even I
      decline to accept the plea. And I say that if your conduct was meant
      kindly, it is a pity that you weren&rsquo;t born cruel. Cruelty would have
      been better. Was it out of kindness that you refused to allow your
      youngest to acquire the skill to earn her own living? Was it out of
      kindness that you thwarted her instinct and filled her soul with regret
      that may be eternal? It was not. I have already indicated, in speaking of
      your son, one of the real reasons. Another was that you took pride in
      having these purely ornamental and loving creatures about you, and you
      would not suffer them to have an interest stronger than their interest in
      you, or a function other than the function of completing your career and
      illustrating your success in the world. If the girl was to play the piano,
      she was to play it in order to perfect your home and minister to your
      pleasure and your vanity, and for naught else. You got what you wanted,
      and you infamously shut your eyes to the risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hear you expostulate that you didn&rsquo;t shut your eyes to the
      risks, and that there will always be risks, and that it is impossible to
      provide fully against all of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which is true, or half true, and the truth or half-truth of the
      statement only renders your case the blacker, O Alpha! Risks are an
      inevitable part of life. They are part of the fine savour and burden of
      life, and without the sense of them life is flat and tasteless. And yet
      you feigned to your women that risk was eliminated from the magic world in
      which you had put them. You deliberately deprived them of the most
      valuable factor in existence&mdash;genuine responsibility. You made them
      ridiculous in the esteem of all persons with a just perception of values.
      You slowly bled them of their self-respect. Had you been less egotistic,
      they might have been happier, even during your lifetime. Your wife would
      have been happier had she been permitted or compelled to feel the weight
      of the estate and to share understandingly the anxieties of your wonderful
      business. Your girls would have been happier had they been cast forcibly
      out of the magic world into the real world for a few hours every day
      during a few years in order to learn its geography, and its customs, and
      the terms on which food and raiment and respect can be obtained in it, and
      the ability to obtain them. And so would you have been happier, fool! You
      sent your girls on the grand tour, but you didn&rsquo;t send them into the
      real world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alpha, the man who cuts off another man&rsquo;s hands is a ruffian.
      The man who cuts off a woman&rsquo;s hands is a scoundrel. There is no
      excuse for him&mdash;none whatever. And the kinder he is the worse he is.
      I repeat that you are the worst sort of scoundrel. Your family mourns you,
      and every member of it says what an angel of a father you were. But you
      were a scoundrel all the same. And at heart every member of the family
      knows it and admits it. Which is rather distressing. And there are
      thousands just like you, Alpha. Yes, even in England there are tens of
      thousands just like you....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you aren&rsquo;t dead yet. I was only asking you to conceive
      that you were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, my dear Alpha,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours affectionately.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A long and violent epistle perhaps. You inquire in what spirit Alpha
      received it. The truth is, he never did receive it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p>
      You naturally assume that before the letter could reach him Alpha had been
      mortally struck down by apoplexy, double pneumonia, bullet, automobile, or
      some such enemy of joy, and that all the dreadful things which I had
      foreseen might happen did in fact happen, thus proving once more what a
      very wise friend I was, and filling me with justifiable pride in my grief.
      But it was not so. Alpha was not struck down, nor did his agreeable house
      topple over the metaphorical precipice. According to poetical justice he
      ought to have been struck down, just to serve him right, and as a warning
      to others&mdash;only he was not. Not merely the wicked, but the
      improvident and the negligent, often flourish like the green bay tree, and
      they keep on flourishing, and setting wisdom and righteousness at defiance
      in the most successful manner. Which, indeed, makes the life of a
      philosopher and sagacious adviser extremely difficult and ungrateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alpha never received my letter because I never sent it. There are letters
      which one writes, not to send, but to ease one&rsquo;s mind. This letter
      was one of them. It would not have been proper to dispatch such a letter.
      Moreover, in the duties of friendship, as distinguished from the pleasures
      of friendship, speech is better, bolder, surer than writing. When two
      friends within hailing distance of each other get to exchanging epistles
      in order to settle a serious difference of opinion, the peril to their
      friendship is indeed grave; and the peril is intensified when one of them
      has adopted a superior moral attitude&mdash;as I had. The letters grow
      longer and longer, ruder and ruder, and the probability of the friendship
      surviving grows ever rapidly less and less. It is&mdash;usually, though
      not always&mdash;a mean act to write what you have not the pluck to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I just kept the letter as a specimen of what I could do&mdash;if I
      chose&mdash;in the high role of candid friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      I said to myself that I would take the first favourable occasion to hint
      to Mr. Alpha how profoundly, etc., etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occasion arrived sooner than I had feared. Alpha had an illness. It
      was not alarming, and yet it was sufficiently formidable. It began with
      colitis, and ended with appendicitis and an operation. Soon after Alpha
      had risen from his bed and was cheerfully but somewhat feebly about again
      I met him at a club. He was sitting in an arm-chair in one of the huge
      bay-windows of the club, and gazing with bright interest upon the varied
      spectacle of the street. The occasion was almost ideal. I took the other
      arm-chair in the semicircle of the window. I saw at once by his careless
      demeanour that his illness had taught him nothing, and I determined with
      all my notorious tact and persuasiveness to point a moral for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And just as I was clearing my throat to begin he exclaimed, with a jerk of
      the elbow and a benevolently satiric smile:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See that girl?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A plainly-dressed young woman carrying a violin-case crossed the street in
      front of our window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see her,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;What about her?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Omega&rsquo;s second daughter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Omega,&rdquo; I murmured. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t seen him for
      ages. What&rsquo;s he doing with himself? Do you ever meet him nowadays?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Mr. Alpha:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I happened to dine with him&mdash;it was chiefly on business&mdash;a
      couple of days before I fell ill. Remarkably strange cove, Omega&mdash;remarkably
      strange.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? How? And what&rsquo;s the matter with the cove&rsquo;s second
      daughter, anyway?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Alpha, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all of a piece&mdash;him
      and his second daughter and the rest of the family. Funny case. It ought
      to interest you. Omega&rsquo;s got a mania.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What mania?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not too easy to describe. Call it the precaution mania.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The precaution mania? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And he told me.
    </p>
    <h3>
      V
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Odd thing,&rdquo; said Alpha, &ldquo;that I should have been at
      Omega&rsquo;s just as I was sickening for appendicitis. He&rsquo;s great
      on appendicitis, is Omega.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he had it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not he! He&rsquo;s never had anything. But he informed me that
      before he went to Mexico last year he took the precaution of having his
      appendix removed, lest he might have acute appendicitis in some wild part
      of the country where there might be no doctor just handy for an operation.
      He&rsquo;s like that, you know. I believe if he had his way there wouldn&rsquo;t
      be an appendix left in the entire family. He&rsquo;s inoculated against
      everything. They&rsquo;re all inoculated against everything. And he keeps
      an elaborate medicine-chest in his house, together with elaborate
      typewritten instructions which he forced his doctor to give him&mdash;in
      case anything awful should happen suddenly. Omega has only to read those
      instructions, and he could stitch a horrible wound, tie up a severed
      artery, or make an injection of morphia or salt water. He has a
      thermometer in every room and one in each bath. Also burglar-alarms at all
      doors and windows, and fire extinguishers on every floor. But that&rsquo;s
      nothing. You should hear about his insurance. Of course, he&rsquo;s
      insured his life and the lives of the whole family of them. He&rsquo;s
      insured against railway accidents and all other accidents, and against
      illness. The fidelity of all his clerks is insured. He&rsquo;s insured
      against burglary, naturally. Against fire, too. And against loss of rent
      through fire. His plate-glass is insured. His bunch of keys is insured. He&rsquo;s
      insured against employers&rsquo; liability. He&rsquo;s insured against
      war. He&rsquo;s insured against loss of business profits. The interest on
      his mortgage securities is insured. His wretched little automobile is
      insured. I do believe he was once insured against the eventuality of
      twins.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must feel safe,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least bit in the world,&rdquo; replied Alpha. &ldquo;Life
      is a perfect burden to him. That wouldn&rsquo;t matter so much if he didn&rsquo;t
      make it a perfect burden to all his family as well. They&rsquo;ve all got
      to be prepared against the worst happening. If he fell down dead his wife
      would know just what to do. She knows all the details of his financial
      position exactly. She has to; he sees to that. He keeps her up to date in
      them every day. And she has to show him detailed accounts of the house as
      though it was a business undertaking, because he&rsquo;s so afraid of her
      being left helpless and incapable. She just has to understand that &lsquo;life
      is real, life is earnest,&rsquo; and death more so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the children. They&rsquo;re all insured, of course. Each of
      the girls has to take charge of the house in turn. And they must all earn
      their own living&mdash;in case papa fell down dead. Take that second
      daughter. She hates music, but she has a certain mechanical facility with
      the fiddle, and so she must turn it into coin, in order to be on the safe
      side. Her instincts are for fine clothes, idleness, and responsibility.
      She&rsquo;d take the risks cheerfully enough if he&rsquo;d let her. But he
      won&rsquo;t. So she&rsquo;s miserable. I think they all are more or less.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But still,&rdquo; I put in, &ldquo;to feel the burden of life is
      not a bad thing for people&rsquo;s characters.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; said Alpha. &ldquo;But to be crushed under a
      cartload of bricks isn&rsquo;t likely to do one much good, is it? Why,
      Omega&rsquo;s a wealthy man, and d&rsquo;you know, he must live on about a
      third of his income. The argument is, as usual, that he&rsquo;s liable to
      fall down dead&mdash;and insurance companies are only human&mdash;and
      anyhow, old age must be amply provided for. And then all his securities
      might fall simultaneously. And lastly, as he says, you never know what may
      happen. Ugh!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anything happened up to now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. An appalling disaster. His drawing-room hearthrug caught
      fire six years ago and was utterly ruined. He got eleven dollars out of
      the insurance company for that, and was ecstatically delighted about it
      for three weeks. Nothing worse ever will happen to Omega. His business is
      one of the safest in the country. His constitution is that of a crocodile
      or a parrot. And he&rsquo;s as cute as they make &lsquo;em.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose you don&rsquo;t envy him?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Alpha.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I ventured, &ldquo;let me offer you a piece of advice.
      Never travel in the same train with Mr. Omega.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never travel in the same train with him? Why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because if there were a railway accident, and you were both killed
      on the spot, the world might draw comparisons between the effect on your
      family and the effect on his, and your family wouldn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      We remained silent for a space, and the silence was dramatic. Nervously, I
      looked out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Alpha said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose there is such a thing as the happy medium.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Alpha.&rdquo; I rose abruptly. &ldquo;Sorry, but I&rsquo;ve
      got to go at once.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And I judiciously departed.

    <h3>
      I

    <p>
      The plain man is not always mature and successful, as I have hitherto
      regarded him. He may be unsuccessful in a worldly sense; but from my
      present point of view I do not much care whether he is unsuccessful in
      that sense. I know that plain men are seldom failures; their very
      plainness saves them from the alarming picturesqueness of the abject
      failure. On the other hand, I care greatly whether the plain man is mature
      or immature, old or young. I should prefer to catch him young. But he is
      difficult to catch young. The fact is that, just as he is seldom a
      failure, so he is seldom young. He becomes plain only with years. In
      youth, even in the thirties, he has fanciful capricious qualities which
      prevent him from being classed with the average sagacious plain man. He
      slowly loses these inconvenient qualities, and develops into part of the
      backbone of the nation. And then it is too late to tell him that he is not
      perfect, simply because he has forgotten to cultivate the master quality
      of all qualities&mdash;namely, imagination. For imagination must be
      cultivated early, and it is just the quality that these admirable plain
      men lack.
    </p>
    <p>
      By imagination I mean the power to conceive oneself in a situation which
      one is not actually in; for instance, in another person&rsquo;s place. It
      is among the sardonic humours of destiny that imagination, while
      positively dangerous in an ill-balanced mind and of the highest value in a
      well-balanced mind, is to be found rather in the former than in the
      latter. And anyhow, the quality is rare in Anglo-Saxon races, which are
      indeed both afraid and ashamed of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet could the plain, the well-balanced Anglo-Saxon male acquire it,
      what a grand world we should live in! The most important thing in the
      world would be transformed. The most important thing in the world is,
      ultimately, married life, and the chief practical use of the quality of
      imagination is to ameliorate married life. But who in England or America
      (or elsewhere) thinks of it in that connection? The plain man considers
      that imagination is all very well for poets and novelists. Blockhead! Yes,
      despite my high esteem for him, I will apply to him the Johnsonian term of
      abuse. Blockhead! Imagination is super-eminently for himself, and was
      beyond doubt invented by Providence in order that the plain man might
      chiefly exercise it in the plain, drudging dailiness of married life. The
      day cometh, if tardily, when he will do so.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II
    </h3>
    <p>
      These reflections have surged up in my brain as I contemplate the recent
      case of my acquaintance, Mr. Omicron, and they are preliminary to a study
      of that interesting case. Scarce a week ago Omicron was sitting in the
      Omicron drawing-room alone with Mrs. Omicron. It was an average Omicron
      evening. Omicron is aged thirty-two. He is neither successful nor
      unsuccessful, and no human perspicacity can say whether twenty years hence
      he will be successful or unsuccessful. But anybody can see that he is
      already on the way to be a plain, well-balanced man. Somewhat earlier than
      usual he is losing the fanciful capricious qualities and settling down
      into the stiff backbone of the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversation was not abundant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Mrs. Omicron suddenly, with an ingratiating accent:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about that ring that I was to have?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, in which every muscle of the man&rsquo;s body, and
      especially the facial muscles, and every secret fibre of his soul,
      perceptibly stiffened. And then Omicron answered, curtly, rebuttingly,
      reprovingly, snappishly, finishingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And took up his newspaper, whose fragile crackling wall defended him from
      attack every bit as well as a screen of twelve-inch armour-plating.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject was dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had endured about ten seconds. But those ten seconds marked an epoch in
      Omicron&rsquo;s career as a husband&mdash;and he knew it not. He knew it
      not, but the whole of his conjugal future had hung evenly in the balance
      during those ten seconds, and then slid slightly but definitely&mdash;to
      the wrong side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, there was more in the affair than appeared on the surface. At
      dinner the otherwise excellent leg of mutton had proved on cutting to be
      most noticeably underdone. Now, it is a monstrous shame that first-class
      mutton should be wasted through inefficient cookery; with third-class
      mutton the crime might have been deemed less awful. Moreover, four days
      previously another excellent dish had been rendered unfit for masculine
      consumption by precisely the same inefficiency or gross negligence, or
      whatever one likes to call it. Nor was that all. The coffee had been thin,
      feeble, uninteresting. The feminine excuse for this last diabolic iniquity
      had been that the kitchen at the last moment had discovered itself to be
      short of coffee. An entirely commonplace episode! Yes, but it is out of
      commonplace episodes that martyrs are made, and Omicron had been made a
      martyr. He, if none else, was fully aware that evening that he was a
      martyr. And the woman had selected just that evening to raise the question
      of rings, gauds, futile ornamentations! He had said little. But he had
      stood for the universal husband, and in Mrs. Omicron he saw the universal
      wife.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III
    </h3>
    <p>
      His reflections ran somewhat thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely a simple matter to keep enough coffee in the house! A
      schoolgirl could do it! And yet they let themselves run short of coffee! I
      ask for nothing out of the way. I make no inordinate demands on the
      household. But I do like good coffee. And I can&rsquo;t have it! Strange!
      As for that mutton&mdash;one would think there was no clock in the
      kitchen. One would think that nobody had ever cooked a leg of mutton
      before. How many legs of mutton have they cooked between them in their
      lives? Scores; hundreds; I dare say thousands. And yet it hasn&rsquo;t yet
      dawned on them that a leg of mutton of a certain weight requires a certain
      time for cooking, and that if it is put down late one of two things must
      occur&mdash;either it will be undercooked or the dinner will be late!
      Simple enough! Logical enough! Four women in the house (three servants and
      the wicked, negligent Mrs. Omicron), and yet they must needs waste a leg
      of mutton through nothing but gross carelessness! It isn&rsquo;t as if it
      hadn&rsquo;t happened before! It isn&rsquo;t as if I hadn&rsquo;t pointed
      it out! But women are amateurs. All women are alike. All housekeeping is
      amateurish. She (Mrs. Omicron, the criminal) has nothing in this world to
      do but run the house&mdash;and see how she runs it! No order! No method!
      Has she ever studied housekeeping scientifically? Not she! Does she care?
      Not she! If she had any real sense of responsibility, if she had the
      slightest glimmering of her own short-comings, she wouldn&rsquo;t have
      started on the ring question. But there you are! She only thinks of
      spending, and titivating herself. I wish she had to do a little earning.
      She&rsquo;d find out a thing or two then. She&rsquo;d find out that life
      isn&rsquo;t all moonstones and motor-cars. Ring, indeed! It&rsquo;s the
      lack of tact that annoys me. I am an ill-used man. All husbands are
      ill-used men. The whole system wants altering. However, I must keep my end
      up. And I will keep my end up. Ring, indeed! No tact!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He fostered a secret fury. And he enjoyed fostering it. There was
      exaggeration in these thoughts, which, he would admit next day, were
      possibly too sweeping in their scope. But he would maintain the essential
      truth of them. He was not really and effectively furious against Mrs.
      Omicron; he did not, as a fact, class her with forgers and drunken
      chauffeurs; indeed, the fellow loved her in his fashion. But he did pass a
      mature judgment against her. He did wrap up his grudge in cotton-wool and
      put it in a drawer and examine it with perverse pleasure now and then. He
      did increase that secretion of poison which weakens the social health of
      nine hundred and ninety-nine in a thousand married lives&mdash;however
      delightful they may be. He did render more permanent a noxious habit of
      mind. He did appreciably and doubly and finally impair the conjugal
      happiness&mdash;for it must not be forgotten that in creating a grievance
      for himself he also gave his wife a grievance. He did, in fine, contribute
      to the general mass of misunderstanding between sex and sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he is reading this, as he assuredly is, Mr. Omicron will up and
      exclaim:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My wife a grievance! Absurd! The facts are incontrovertible. What
      grievance can she have?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The grievance that Mr. Omicron, becoming every day more and more the plain
      man, is not exercising imagination in the very field where it is most
      needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is a home, Mr. Omicron? You reply that a home is a home. You have
      always had a home. You were born in one. With luck you will die in one.
      And you have never regarded a home as anything but a home. Your leading
      idea has ever been that a home is emphatically not an office nor a
      manufactory. But suppose you were to unscale your eyes&mdash;that is to
      say, use your imagination&mdash;try to see that a home, in addition to
      being a home, is an office and manufactory for the supply of light,
      warmth, cleanliness, ease, and food to a given number of people? Suppose
      you were to allow it to occur to you that a home emphatically is an
      organization similar to an office and manufactory&mdash;and an extremely
      complicated and delicate one, with many diverse departments, functioning
      under extremely difficult conditions? For thus it in truth is. Could you
      once accomplish this feat of imaginative faculty, you would never again
      say, with that disdainful accent of yours: &ldquo;Mrs. Omicron has nothing
      in the world to do but run the house.&rdquo; For really it would be just
      as clever for her to say: &ldquo;Mr. Omicron has nothing in the world to
      do but run the office.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      I admit heartily that Mrs. Omicron is not perfect. She ought to be, of
      course; but she, alas! falls short of the ideal. Yet in some details she
      can and does show the way to that archangel, her husband. When her office
      and manufactory goes wrong, you, Mr. Omicron, are righteously indignant
      and superior. You majestically wonder that with four women in the house,
      etc., etc. But when you come home and complain that things are askew in
      your masculine establishment, and that a period of economy must set in,
      does she say to you with scorn: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t dare to mention coffee
      to-night. I really wonder that with fourteen (or a hundred and forty)
      grown men in your establishment you cannot produce an ample and regular
      income?&rdquo; No; she makes the best of it. She is sympathetic. And you,
      Mr. Omicron, would be excessively startled and wounded if she were not
      sympathetic. Put your imagination to work and you will see how interesting
      are these comparisons.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV
    </h3>
    <p>
      She is an amateur at her business, you say. Well, perhaps she is. But who
      brought her up to be an amateur? Are you not content to carry on the
      ancient tradition? As you meditate, and you often do meditate, upon that
      infant daughter of yours now sleeping in her cot, do you dream of giving
      her a scientific education in housekeeping, or do you dream of endowing
      her with the charms that music and foreign languages and physical grace
      can offer? Do you in your mind&rsquo;s eye see her cannily choosing beef
      at the butcher&rsquo;s, or shining for your pleasure in the drawing-room?
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Mrs. Omicron is, perhaps, not so much of an amateur as you
      assume. People learn by practice. Is there any reason in human nature why
      a complex machine such as a house may be worked with fewer breakdowns than
      an office or manufactory? Harness your imagination once more and transfer
      to your house the multitudinous minor catastrophes that happen in your
      office. Be sincere, and admit that the efficiency of the average office is
      naught but a pretty legend. A mistake or negligence or forgetfulness in an
      office is remedied and forgotten. Mrs. Omicron&mdash;my dear Mr. Omicron&mdash;never
      hears of it. Not so with Mrs. Omicron&rsquo;s office, as your aroused
      imagination will tell you. Mrs. Omicron&rsquo;s parlourmaid&rsquo;s duster
      fails to make contact with one small portion of the hall-table. Mr.
      Omicron walks in, and his godlike glance drops instantly on the dusty
      place, and Mr. Omicron ejaculates sardonically: &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! Four
      women in the house, and they can&rsquo;t even keep the hall-table
      respectable!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Omicron forgets a letter at the bottom of his unanswered-letter
      basket, and a week later an excited cable arrives from overseas, and that
      cable demands another cable. No real harm has been done. Ten dollars spent
      on cables have cured the ill. Mrs. Omicron, preoccupied with a rash on the
      back of the neck of Miss Omicron before-mentioned, actually comes back
      from town without having ordered the mutton. In the afternoon she realizes
      her horrid sin and rushes to the telephone. The butcher reassures her. He
      swears the desired leg shall arrive. But do you see that boy dallying at
      the street corner with his mate? He carries the leg of mutton, and he
      carries also, though he knows it not nor cares, the reputation and
      happiness of Mrs. Omicron. He is late. As you yourself remarked, Mr.
      Omicron, if a leg of mutton is put down late to roast, one of two things
      must occur&mdash;either it will be under-cooked or the dinner will be
      late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if housekeeping was as simple as office-keeping, Mrs. Omicron would
      smile in tranquillity at the <i>contretemps</i>, and say to herself:
      &ldquo;Never mind, I shall pay the late-posting fee&mdash;that will give
      me an extra forty minutes.&rdquo; <i>You</i> say that, Mr. Omicron, about
      your letters, when you happen to have taken three hours for lunch and your
      dictation of correspondence is thereby postponed. Only there is no
      late-posting fee in Mrs. Omicron&rsquo;s world. If Mrs. Omicron flung four
      cents at you when you came home, and informed you that dinner would be
      forty minutes late and that she was paying the fee, what, Mr. Omicron,
      would be your state of mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      And your imagination, now very alert, will carry you even farther than
      this, Mr. Omicron, and disclose to you still more fearful difficulties
      which Mrs. Omicron has to face in the management of her office or
      manufactory. Her staff is uneducated, less educated even than yours. And
      her staff is universally characterized by certain peculiarities of
      mentality. For example, her staff will never, never, never, come and say
      to her: &ldquo;Please, ma&rsquo;am, there is only enough coffee left for
      two days.&rdquo; No! Her staff will placidly wait forty-eight hours, and
      then come at 7 p.m. and say: &ldquo;Please, ma&rsquo;am, there isn&rsquo;t
      enough coffee&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; And worse! You, Mr. Omicron, can say
      roundly to a clerk: &ldquo;Look here, if this occurs again I shall fling
      you into the street.&rdquo; You are aware, and he is aware, that a hundred
      clerks are waiting to take his place. On the other hand, a hundred
      mistresses are waiting to take the place of Mrs. Omicron with regard to
      her cook. Mrs. Omicron has to do as best she can. She has to speak softly
      and to temper discipline, because the supply of domestic servants is
      unequal to the demand. And there is still worse. The worst of all, the
      supreme disadvantage under which Mrs. Omicron suffers, is that most of her
      errors, lapses, crimes, directly affect a man in the stomach, and the man
      is a hungry man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Omicron, your imagination, now feverishly active, will thus
      demonstrate to you that your wife&rsquo;s earthly lot is not the velvet
      couch that you had unimaginatively assumed it to be, and that, indeed, you
      would not change places with her for a hundred thousand a year. Your
      attitude towards her human limitations will be modified, and the general
      mass of misunderstanding between sex and sex will tend to diminish.
    </p>
    <p>
      (And if even yet your attitude is not modified, let your imagination dwell
      for a few instants on the extraordinary number of bad and expensive hotels
      with which you are acquainted&mdash;managed, not by amateurish women, but
      by professional men. And on the obstinate mismanagement of the
      commissariat of your own club&mdash;of which you are continually
      complaining to members of the house-committee.)
    </p>
    <h3>
      V
    </h3>
    <p>
      I pass to another aspect of Mr. Omicron&rsquo;s private reflections
      consequent upon Mrs. Omicron&rsquo;s dreadful failure of tact in asking
      him about the ring after the mutton had proved to be underdone and the
      coffee to be inadequate. &ldquo;She only thinks of spending,&rdquo;
      reflected Mr. Omicron, resentfully. A more or less true reflection, no
      doubt, but there would have been a different colour to it if Mr. Omicron
      had exercised the greatest of his faculties. Suppose you were to unscale
      your eyes, Mr. Omicron&mdash;that is to say, use your imagination&mdash;and
      try to see that so far as finance is concerned your wife&rsquo;s chief and
      proper occupation in life is to spend. Conceive what you would say if she
      announced one morning: &ldquo;Henry, I am sick of spending. I am going out
      into the world to earn.&rdquo; Can you not hear yourself employing a
      classic phrase about &ldquo;the woman&rsquo;s sphere&rdquo;? In brief,
      there would occur an altercation and a shindy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your imagination, once set in motion, will show you that your conjugal
      existence is divided into two great departments&mdash;the getting and the
      spending departments. Wordsworth chanted that in getting and spending we
      lay waste our powers. We could not lay waste our powers in a more
      satisfying manner. The two departments, mutually indispensable, balance
      each other. You organized them. You made yourself the head of one and your
      wife the head of the other. You might, of course, have organized them
      otherwise. It was open to you in the Hottentot style to decree that your
      wife should do the earning while you did the spending. But for some
      mysterious reason this arrangement did not appeal to you, and you
      accordingly go forth daily to the office and return therefrom with money.
      The theory of your daily excursion is firmly based in the inherent nature
      of things. The theory is the fundamental cosmic one that money is made in
      order that money may be spent&mdash;either at once or later. Even the
      miser conforms to this theory, for he only saves in obedience to the
      argument that the need of spending in the future may be more imperious
      than is the need of spending at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole of your own personal activity is a mere preliminary to the
      activity of Mrs. Omicron. Without hers, yours would be absurd, ridiculous,
      futile, supremely silly. By spending she completes and justifies your
      labour; she crowns your life by spending. You married her so that she
      might spend. You wanted some one to spend, and it was understood that she
      should fill the situation. She was brought up to spend, and you knew that
      she was brought up to spend. Spending is her vocation. And yet you turn
      round on her and complain, &ldquo;She only thinks of spending.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;but there is such a thing as
      moderation.&rdquo; There is; I admit it. The word &ldquo;extravagance&rdquo;
      is no idle word in the English language. It describes a quality which
      exists. Let it be an axiom that Mrs. Omicron is human. Just as the
      tendency to get may grow on you, until you become a rapacious and stingy
      money-grubber, so the tendency to spend may grow on her. One has known
      instances. A check-action must be occasionally employed. Agreed! But, Mr.
      Omicron, you should choose a time and a tone for employing it other than
      you chose on this evening that I have described. A man who mixes up
      jewelled rings with undertone mutton and feeble coffee is a clumsy man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exercise your imagination to put yourself in the place of Mrs. Omicron,
      and you will perceive that she is constantly in the highly delicate
      difficulty of having to ask for money, or at any rate of having to suggest
      or insinuate that money should be given to her. It is her right and even
      her duty to ask for money, but the foolish, illogical creature&mdash;like
      most women, even those with generous and polite husbands&mdash;regards the
      process as a little humiliating for herself. You, Mr. Omicron, have
      perhaps never asked for money. But your imagination will probably be able
      to make you feel how it feels to ask for money. A woman whose business in
      life it is to spend money which she does not and cannot earn may sometimes
      have to face a refusal when she asks for money. But there is one thing
      from which she ought to be absolutely and eternally safe&mdash;and that is
      a snub.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VI
    </h3>
    <p>
      And finally, in his reflections as an ill-used man tied for life to a
      woman who knows not tact, Mr. Omicron asserted further that Mrs. Omicron
      only thought of spending and titivating herself. To assert that she only
      thought of spending did not satisfy his spleen; he must add &ldquo;titivating
      herself.&rdquo; He would admit, of course, that she did as a fact
      sometimes think of other matters, but still he would uphold the gravamen
      of his charge. And yet&mdash;excellent Omicron!&mdash;you have but to look
      the truth in the face&mdash;as a plain common-sense man will&mdash;and to
      use your imagination, in order to perceive that there really is no
      gravamen in the charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did you insist on marrying Mrs. Omicron? She had the reputation of
      being a good housekeeper (as girls go); she was a serious girl,
      kind-hearted, of irreproachable family, having agreeable financial
      expectations, clever, well-educated, good-tempered, pretty. But the truth
      is that you married her for none of these attributes. You married her
      because you were attracted to her; and what attracted you was a
      mysterious, never-to-be-defined quality about her&mdash;an effluence, an
      emanation, a lurking radiance, an entirely enigmatic charm. In the end
      &ldquo;charm&rdquo; is the one word that even roughly indicates that
      element in her personality which caused you to lose your head about her. A
      similar phenomenon is to be observed in all marriages of inclination. A
      similar phenomenon is at the bottom of most social movements. Why, the Men&rsquo;s
      League for Women&rsquo;s Suffrage itself certainly came into being through
      the strange workings of that same phenomenon! You married Mrs. Omicron
      doubtless because she was &ldquo;suitable,&rdquo; but her &ldquo;suitability,&rdquo;
      for you, consisted in the way she breathed, the way she crossed a room, a
      transient gesture, a vibration in her voice, a blush, a glance, the curve
      of an arm&mdash;nothing, nothing&mdash;and yet everything!
    </p>
    <p>
      You may condescend towards this quality of hers, Mr. Omicron&mdash;you may
      try to dismiss it as &ldquo;feminine charm,&rdquo; and have done with it.
      But you cannot have done with it. And the fact will ever remain that you
      are incapable of supplying it yourself, with all your talents and your
      divine common sense. You are an extremely wise and good man, but you
      cannot ravish the senses of a roomful of people by merely walking
      downstairs, by merely throwing a shawl over your shoulders, by a curious
      depression in the corner of one cheek. This gift of grace is not yours.
      Wise as you are, you will be still wiser if you do not treat it
      disdainfully. It is among the supreme things in the world. It has made a
      mighty lot of history, and not improbably will make some more&mdash;even
      yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      You were not the only person aware of the formidable power (for formidable
      it was) which she possessed over you. She, too, was aware of it, and is
      still. She knows that when she exists in a particular way, she will
      produce in your existence a sensation which, though fleeting, you prefer
      to all other sensations&mdash;a sensation unique. And this quality by
      which she disturbs and enchants you is her main resource in the adventure
      of life. Shall she not cherish this quality, adorn it, intensify it? On
      the contrary, you well know that you would be very upset and amazed if
      Mrs. Omicron were to show signs of neglecting this quality of hers which
      yearns for rings. And, if you have ever entered a necktie-shop and been
      dazzled by the spectacle of a fine necktie into &ldquo;hanging expense&rdquo;&mdash;if
      you have been through this wondrous experience, your imagination, duly
      prodded, will enable you to put yourself into Mrs. Omicron&rsquo;s place
      when she mentions the subject of rings. &ldquo;Titivating herself?&rdquo;
      Good heavens, she is helping the very earth to revolve! And you smote the
      defenceless creature with a lethal word&mdash;because the butcher&rsquo;s
      boy dallied at a street-corner!
    </p>
    <p>
      You insinuate that one frail hand may carry too many rings. You reproduce
      your favourite word &ldquo;moderation.&rdquo; Mr. Omicron, I take you. I
      agree as to the danger. But if Mrs. Omicron is human, let us also bear in
      mind the profound truth that not one of us is more human than another.
    </p>

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
